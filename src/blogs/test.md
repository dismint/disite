# Overview

Here is a piece of code in zig that i think will make people happy. It might not make all people happy, but it sure did make me happy so I hope that it makes you happy as well.

```zig
const std = @import("std");

pub fn main() {
    std.debug.print("Hello, World!", .{});
}
```

This is some zig code. As you can clearly see, it is just beautiful and makes me want to cry. `this` is some inline text
